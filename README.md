# Functional Response Modeling

Supporting materials for the functional response manuscript: analysis code, machine-readable results, and FEP starting poses.

The analysis code in the folder `analysis` reads the results and labels from the folder `results` and reproduces the plots from the manuscript.
For each target, we provide the FEP starting poses as Maestro files (.mae) and, where applicable, the files defining the restraints in CMS format in the folder `setup`.

- OPRD1 - delta-opioid receptor
- OPRM1 - mu-opioid receptor
- HTR1B - serotonin receptor 1B
